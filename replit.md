# Interactive RPG Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with Express.js backend and React frontend, featuring a unique Phaser 3-based interactive portfolio website that mimics the intro screen of Pok√©mon Fire Red. The application combines modern web technologies with retro gaming elements to create an engaging portfolio experience.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **React Three Fiber** for 3D graphics capabilities (prepared for future features)

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **In-memory storage** with interface abstraction for future database migration
- **RESTful API** structure (routes ready for implementation)
- **Session management** with PostgreSQL session store integration

### Database Strategy
- **Drizzle ORM** configured for PostgreSQL
- **Neon Database** as the cloud PostgreSQL provider
- **Schema-first approach** with type-safe database operations
- **Migration system** with Drizzle Kit for schema evolution

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds React application to `dist/public`
2. **Backend**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Assets**: Static files served from client directory
4. **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied via `db:push` command

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Uses Vite dev server with HMR
- **Production**: Static file serving with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable

### Deployment Targets
- **Replit**: Optimized for Replit deployment with runtime error handling
- **Node.js**: Standard Node.js deployment with ES modules
- **Static hosting**: Frontend can be deployed separately if needed
