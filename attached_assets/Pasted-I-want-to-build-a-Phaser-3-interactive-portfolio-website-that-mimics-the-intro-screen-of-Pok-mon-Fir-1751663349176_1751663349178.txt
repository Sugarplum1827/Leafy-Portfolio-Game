I want to build a Phaser 3 interactive portfolio website that mimics the intro screen of Pokémon Fire Red, followed by a top-down RPG map where users can explore and interact with NPCs to learn about me.

Here is the exact specification:

🎬 1. Intro Scene (Mimics Fire Red)
The screen is black, and then fades in to show a single NPC (me, Jacob) in the center of the screen, standing still.

Above or next to the NPC is text that says:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Jacob's Portfolio
Press ENTER to Start
Text should flicker gently like a GBA intro.

Pressing Enter will transition (with fade effect) to the main world map.

🗺️ 2. Main Town Map (Like Pewter Town)
Build a tile-based RPG map with collisions using Phaser 3 and a Tiled tilemap. It includes:

Area	Description
🌸 Flower field + signpost	Shows my Introduction
🏠 Black roof house #1	NPC with Reference #1
🏠 Black roof house #2	NPC with Reference #2
🟫 Brown roof house	NPC with Work Experience
🔴 Red roof building	NPC with Organizations Joined
🔵 Blue roof building	NPC with Certificates & Diplomas
🟪 Big purple roof museum	NPC with Projects
🟪 Small purple roof hut (beside museum)	Final NPC (a clone of me) that says:

“This is my portfolio. Thank you for exploring.”

After that message finishes, the game resets to the intro screen

🎮 3. Controls
W, A, S, D = Movement

Face NPC and press Spacebar = Dialogue starts

Press Spacebar again to continue through messages

🧍 4. NPC Interaction System
Only when the player is facing an NPC closely

Shows dialog box at bottom of screen

Typing animation (Pokémon-style)

Each NPC has a unique set of dialogue lines (text can be in a JSON or array)

🧰 5. Project Structure
Please create a complete Phaser 3 project:

bash
Copy
Edit
index.html
style.css
main.js
/scenes/
    IntroScene.js
    TownScene.js
/assets/
    /tilesets/
    /sprites/
    /maps/
Use placeholder assets (GBA-style tiles, character sprite, NPC sprites)

Use Phaser 3 from CDN (via index.html)

✅ Additional Requirements:
All code must run in browser (no backend)

Phaser version must be latest and stable

Use Phaser’s Scene system to separate Intro and Town map

Easy to customize later (use placeholder text now)

Collision system in place

Simple retro pixel font optional

Begin by:

Creating the IntroScene where Jacob's NPC says “Jacob's Portfolio – Press ENTER to Start”

On Enter press, transition to TownScene with tilemap and character movement

Add NPCs and interaction logic

I want a Pokémon Fire Red–style experience turned into a portfolio game.
